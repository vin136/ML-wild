Focus Timeline

1. **Subject Matter Expertise**
- Prep Start-date - end-date(two months)
  - Jan 22-2022 : Mar 22-2022

`Tasks`
- [ ] ` Bounded tests`
  - [ ] SQL
  - [ ] PANDAS
  - [ ] LeetCode (easy/medium)
- [ ] `Unbounded tests` 
  - [ ] **Breadth and System desigen notes**: at medium level.(strictly interview standard/minimum knowledge expected from a candidate)
  - [ ] **Depth/Projects**: Should have completed 2/3 resume ready projs through coursework.

`TODO`

**PANDAS**

Read through official [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html)

Solve questions from [StrataScratch](https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10308-salaries-differences?python=1)

Do one leetcode everyday starting jan-31-2022.And also revise all questions done by the end of deadline.

## General ML Interview Structure

- [Amazon DS Interview](https://mlengineer.io/how-i-got-amazon-data-scientist-offer-2021-within-2-months-preparation-82e335229282)


## Unbounded Tests

1. ML BREDTH
2. ML DEPTH
3. System Design

### Strategy

**Bredth**

- **Make notes for each model as you go through classes.**

**Depth**

- Focus on doing end-end projects and prepare a good project report (use class project)

**System Design**

There are two kinds. 

- One involves taking a closed form specific problem and detail all ML specific steps.
What data to choose,design of loss functions,models,metrics etc.

- General knowledge about the common approaches used in the domain.
Read Case studies.

## Bounded tests

Pandas,SQL manipulation,leetcode easy/medium.
